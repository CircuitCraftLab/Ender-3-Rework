# Ender-3-Rework
This repository contains all the necessary improvements for the world's most popular 3d printer Ender 3. The project includes all the necessary components, from a frame with kinematics to electronics (probably software too).
The entire mechanical part of the project was made in the Autodesk Inventor 2023 environment and the electronics in Altium Designer 23.
This project is mostly not suitable for those who want to build their first 3d printer from scratch, but more for those who already have an Ender 3 and want to upgrade it to the highest possible level without significant costs.
If you still consider this project as a starting point for your first 3d printer, then take care of the possibility of obtaining 3d printed parts.
